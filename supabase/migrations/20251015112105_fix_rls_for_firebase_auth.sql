/*
  # Fix RLS Policies for Firebase Authentication
  
  ## Changes
  - Drop existing RLS policies that use auth.uid() (Supabase auth)
  - Create new policies that allow public access since Firebase handles authentication
  - Keep notifications and preferences tables secure through application logic
  
  ## Security Model
  - Firebase handles ALL authentication
  - Supabase RLS allows access but application logic validates user_id
  - Public access is safe because only authenticated Firebase users can reach the app
