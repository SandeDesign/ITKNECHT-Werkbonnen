  # Add Task Completion Status Fields

  ## Overview
  This migration adds fields to support enhanced task completion tracking with status options
  and completion notes. These fields work with the existing Firebase todos collection but
  are documented here for reference and future Supabase integration.

  ## New Fields Added to Firebase 'todos' Collection
  
  ### Completion Status Fields
  - `completionStatus` (string, optional)
    - Values: 'completed', 'completed_with_issues', 'failed'
    - Indicates how the task was completed
    - Only set when task is marked as completed
  
  - `completionNotes` (string, optional)
    - Free-text notes about task completion
    - Required when status is 'failed'
    - Optional for other completion statuses
  
  - `completedAt` (timestamp, optional)
    - ISO 8601 timestamp of when task was completed
    - Set automatically when task is marked as completed
  
  - `completedBy` (string, optional)
    - User ID of the person who completed the task
    - Set automatically from current user context

  ## Notes
  - These fields are added dynamically by the application code
  - No database schema changes are needed as Firebase is schemaless
  - This migration serves as documentation for the data model
  - Future Supabase integration can reference these field definitions

  ## Integration with Notifications
  - Completion status is included in admin notifications
  - Completion notes are sent to admins when provided
  - Notification metadata includes full completion details
